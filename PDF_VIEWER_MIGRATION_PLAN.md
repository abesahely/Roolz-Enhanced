### Key Implementation Challenges
1. **Worker Loading**: Ensuring PDF.js worker is properly loaded
2. **Memory Management**: Preventing memory leaks with large documents
3. **Mobile Safari Support**: Addressing iOS-specific rendering issues
4. **Fabric.js Integration**: Synchronizing annotation layer with PDF pages
5. **Performance Optimization**: Ensuring smooth experience on mobile

### Mobile-Specific Considerations
1. **Touch Handling**: Implement proper touch events for smooth scrolling and zooming
2. **Optimized Rendering**: Use progressive loading and reduced quality on initial render
3. **Memory Constraints**: Be extra careful with memory usage on mobile devices
4. **Platform Detection**: Apply iOS-specific fixes for Safari
5. **Loading Indicators**: Provide clear visual feedback for all operations

### Strategic Pivot: PDF.js Pre-built Viewer Implementation

After facing significant challenges with React-PDF integration in the Replit environment, we're pivoting to a more reliable solution using the PDF.js pre-built viewer. This approach offers several advantages:

1. **Reliability**: The pre-built viewer is extensively tested and works across various environments
2. **Completeness**: Includes all necessary features like annotations, navigation, and mobile support
3. **Compatibility**: Confirmed to work in restricted environments like Replit
4. **Maintenance**: Maintained by Mozilla with regular updates and broad community support

#### New Implementation Approach

The PDF.js pre-built viewer will be integrated through iframes with proper customization for beNext.io branding. This approach requires less code and avoids the worker communication issues we've encountered.

1. **Base Implementation**
   ```tsx
   // PDFViewerComponent.tsx
   interface PDFJSViewerProps {
     file: File | null;
     onClose: () => void;
     initialPage?: number;
     className?: string;
   }
   
   const PDFJSViewer: React.FC<PDFJSViewerProps> = ({
     file,
     onClose,
     initialPage = 1,
     className = ''
   }) => {
     const [viewerUrl, setViewerUrl] = useState<string | null>(null);
     
     // Generate viewer URL when file changes
     useEffect(() => {
       if (!file) return;
       
       // Create blob URL for the PDF
       const blobUrl = URL.createObjectURL(file);
       
       // Construct viewer URL with parameters
       const baseViewerUrl = 'https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/web/viewer.html';
       const viewerWithParams = `${baseViewerUrl}?file=${encodeURIComponent(blobUrl)}#page=${initialPage}`;
       
       setViewerUrl(viewerWithParams);
       
       return () => {
         // Clean up blob URL when component unmounts
         URL.revokeObjectURL(blobUrl);
       };
     }, [file, initialPage]);
     
     // Render loading state if URL isn't ready
     if (!viewerUrl) {
       return <div className="loading">Loading PDF viewer...</div>;
     }
     
     return (
       <div className={`pdf-viewer-container ${className}`}>
         <div className="pdf-viewer-toolbar">
           <button 
             onClick={onClose}
             className="close-button"
           >
             Close
           </button>
         </div>
         
         <iframe
           src={viewerUrl}
           title="PDF Viewer"
           className="pdf-viewer-iframe"
           style={{
             border: 'none',
             width: '100%',
             height: 'calc(100% - 40px)', // Account for toolbar
           }}
         />
       </div>
     );
   };
   ```

2. **Custom CSS for beNext.io Branding**
   ```css
   /* Custom CSS for PDF.js viewer (injected through postMessage) */
   :root {
     --main-color: #0A1E45;
     --main-color-hover: #1E3A6C;
     --secondary-color: #F4871F;
     --secondary-color-hover: #F6A04C;
     --text-color: #FFFFFF;
   }
   
   #toolbarViewer {
     background-color: var(--main-color);
   }
   
   .toolbarButton {
     color: var(--text-color);
   }
   
   .toolbarButton:hover {
     background-color: var(--main-color-hover);
   }
   
   .toolbarButton.toggled {
     background-color: var(--secondary-color);
   }
   ```

3. **Cross-Frame Communication for Enhanced Control**
   ```tsx
   useEffect(() => {
     // Set up message listener for iframe communication
     const handleMessage = (event: MessageEvent) => {
       // Verify origin for security
       if (event.origin !== 'https://mozilla.github.io') return;
       
       const data = event.data;
       
       // Handle various messages from the viewer
       switch (data.type) {
         case 'pagechange':
           if (onPageChange) onPageChange(data.pageNumber);
           break;
         case 'documentloaded':
           console.log('PDF loaded successfully');
           break;
         case 'error':
           console.error('PDF viewer error:', data.message);
           break;
       }
     };
     
     window.addEventListener('message', handleMessage);
     return () => window.removeEventListener('message', handleMessage);
   }, [onPageChange]);
   ```

4. **Local Viewer Implementation (Alternative to CDN)**
   ```tsx
   // For better control, we can host the viewer locally
   const LOCAL_VIEWER_PATH = '/pdf-viewer/web/viewer.html';
   
   // Then use it in the component
   const viewerWithParams = `${LOCAL_VIEWER_PATH}?file=${encodeURIComponent(blobUrl)}#page=${initialPage}`;
   ```
