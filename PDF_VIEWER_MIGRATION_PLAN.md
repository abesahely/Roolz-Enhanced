### Key Implementation Challenges
1. **Worker Loading**: Ensuring PDF.js worker is properly loaded
2. **Memory Management**: Preventing memory leaks with large documents
3. **Mobile Safari Support**: Addressing iOS-specific rendering issues
4. **Fabric.js Integration**: Synchronizing annotation layer with PDF pages
5. **Performance Optimization**: Ensuring smooth experience on mobile

### Mobile-Specific Considerations
1. **Touch Handling**: Implement proper touch events for smooth scrolling and zooming
2. **Optimized Rendering**: Use progressive loading and reduced quality on initial render
3. **Memory Constraints**: Be extra careful with memory usage on mobile devices
4. **Platform Detection**: Apply iOS-specific fixes for Safari
5. **Loading Indicators**: Provide clear visual feedback for all operations

### SimplePDF.com Worker Implementation Approach - Revised
After deeper analysis of SimplePDF.com's implementation, we've discovered they use dynamic imports with proper bundling. Here's our revised approach:

1. **Dynamic Worker Import**
   ```typescript
   // pdfjs-worker-setup.ts
   import { pdfjs } from 'react-pdf';
   
   const loadPdfWorker = async () => {
     try {
       // Dynamic import creates a separate chunk during build
       const workerModule = await import('pdfjs-dist/build/pdf.worker.js');
       return workerModule;
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Failed to load PDF.js worker:', error);
       throw error;
     }
   };
   
   export const initializeWorker = async () => {
     try {
       const workerModule = await loadPdfWorker();
       pdfjs.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = workerModule;
       
       // Set global flags for debugging
       (window as any).__PDFJS_WORKER_INITIALIZED = true;
       (window as any).__PDFJS_WORKER_VERSION = '4.8.69';
       (window as any).__PDFJS_WORKER_METHOD = 'dynamic-import';
       
       return true;
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Worker initialization failed:', error);
       return false;
     }
   };
   ```

2. **Early Asynchronous Initialization**
   ```typescript
   // main.tsx (at top)
   import { initializeWorker } from './pdfjs-worker-setup';
   
   // Initialize worker as early as possible
   initializeWorker().catch(err => {
     console.error('Failed to initialize PDF.js worker:', err);
   });
   ```

3. **Vite Configuration Update for Worker**
   ```typescript
   // vite.config.ts
   export default defineConfig({
     // Other configuration...
     build: {
       // Ensure the worker is properly chunked during build
       rollupOptions: {
         output: {
           manualChunks: {
             'pdf.worker': ['pdfjs-dist/build/pdf.worker.js']
           }
         }
       }
     }
   });
   ```

4. **Component Initialization with Worker Ready Check**
   ```typescript
   // PDFViewerContainer.tsx
   useEffect(() => {
     const checkWorker = async () => {
       if (!(window as any).__PDFJS_WORKER_INITIALIZED) {
         try {
           await initializeWorker();
           console.log('Worker initialized from component');
         } catch (error) {
           setError(new Error('Failed to initialize PDF.js worker'));
         }
       }
     };
     
     checkWorker();
   }, []);
   ```

5. **Improved Error Handling and Diagnostics**
   ```typescript
   // Additional diagnostics in PDFDocument.tsx
   useEffect(() => {
     // Log worker status on mount
     console.log('Worker status:', {
       initialized: (window as any).__PDFJS_WORKER_INITIALIZED,
       version: (window as any).__PDFJS_WORKER_VERSION,
       method: (window as any).__PDFJS_WORKER_METHOD,
       workerSrc: pdfjs.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc
     });
   }, []);
   ```

This approach properly bundles the worker file with Vite, making it accessible from the same origin as the main application, avoiding the issues we encountered with direct node_modules references.

### Memory Management Strategy
- Track and clean up pages that are not in view
- Implement proper unmount cleanup
- Monitor memory usage during development
- Use worker threads for heavy processing

   - Remove the navigation button to the test page from the Home page

2. **Remove Feature Flag System:**
   - Remove the `PDFViewerToggle.tsx` component
   - Remove the `featureFlags.ts` utility file
   - Update any imports that reference these components

3. **Deprecate Legacy Components:**
   - Mark the old PDFViewer component as deprecated
   - Eventually remove the legacy PDFViewer implementation
